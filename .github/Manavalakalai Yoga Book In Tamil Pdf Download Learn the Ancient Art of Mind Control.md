# Manavalakalai Yoga: A Simplified Approach to Kundalini Yoga
 
Manavalakalai Yoga is a system of yoga developed by Shri Vethathiri Maharishi, a spiritual leader and visionary from Tamil Nadu, India. Manavalakalai Yoga aims to simplify the practice of Kundalini Yoga, which is an ancient form of yoga that involves awakening the latent energy at the base of the spine and channeling it upwards through the chakras or energy centers. Manavalakalai Yoga consists of physical exercises, breathing techniques, meditation, introspection and ethical living. It is designed to help people achieve physical, mental and spiritual well-being.
 
Manavalakalai Yoga is based on the principles of Vethathiri Maharishi's philosophy, which he called "Vethathiriyam". Vethathiriyam is a holistic worldview that integrates science and spirituality. It explains the origin and evolution of the universe, the nature and functions of consciousness, the causes and effects of karma, and the ways to attain self-realization. Vethathiriyam also offers practical solutions for the problems faced by humanity, such as violence, poverty, pollution and disease.

WCSC has branches all over India and abroad, and conducts regular courses and workshops on Manavalakalai Yoga. WCSC also publishes books, magazines and journals on various aspects of Vethathiriyam and Manavalakalai Yoga.
