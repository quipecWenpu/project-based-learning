## Conclusion
 
Gerix Wifi Cracker is a useful tool for WiFi hacking on Windows 7. It has a simple and intuitive GUI that makes it easy for beginners to use. However, it is not updated frequently and it may not work with some newer wireless cards or drivers. If you encounter any problems or want to try other WiFi hacking tools, you can also check out SourceForge[^2^] or Darknet[^3^] for more options.
  
## Step 4: Scan for Available Networks
 
Once you have launched Gerix Wifi Cracker, you can start scanning for available networks. To do this, click on the Configuration tab and select your wireless interface from the drop-down menu. Then click on the Scan button to start scanning. You will see a list of networks with their SSIDs, encryption types, channels, and signal strengths.
 
## Step 5: Capture Handshakes
 
To crack a WiFi password, you need to capture a handshake between the network and a client. A handshake is a process of authentication that occurs when a client connects to a network. Gerix Wifi Cracker can help you capture handshakes by performing various attacks on the network. To do this, click on the Attack tab and select one of the options from the menu. For example, you can use the Fake Authentication Attack to associate with the network without knowing the password. Then you can use the ARP Request Replay Attack to generate traffic and capture handshakes.
 
## Step 6: Crack Passwords
 
After capturing a handshake, you can try to crack the password using a dictionary attack. A dictionary attack is a method of guessing passwords by using a list of common words or phrases. Gerix Wifi Cracker can help you perform a dictionary attack by using its built-in wordlists or your own custom wordlists. To do this, click on the Cracking tab and select WPA/WPA2 Cracking from the menu. Then select the handshake file and the wordlist file and click on Start Cracking. Gerix Wifi Cracker will try to match the password with the words in the wordlist and display it if it finds a match.
 
## Tips for WiFi Hacking
 
WiFi hacking is not always easy or fast. It depends on many factors, such as the encryption type, the password strength, the signal quality, and the network traffic. Here are some tips to improve your chances of success:
 
- Choose a network with a strong signal and low traffic. This will make it easier to capture handshakes and crack passwords.
- Choose a network with WEP or WPA encryption. These are older and weaker encryption standards that are easier to crack than WPA2 or WPA3.
- Use a large and diverse wordlist. This will increase your chances of finding a match for the password. You can find many wordlists online or create your own using tools like Crunch.
- Use other tools and methods. Gerix Wifi Cracker is not the only tool for WiFi hacking. You can also use other tools like Aircrack-ng, Wireshark, Reaver, or Hashcat. You can also use other methods like brute force, rainbow tables, or social engineering.
