## Step 4: Explore AppCode 2019.2 Features
 
Now that you have AppCode 2019.2 installed and running, you can enjoy its features and improvements that make iOS and macOS development easier and more productive. Here are some of the highlights:
 
### Swift 5.1 Support
 
AppCode 2019.2 supports the latest Swift 5.1 features, such as:

- Synthesize default values for the memberwise initializer
- Static and class subscripts
- Expanding Swift Self to class members and value types
- Library Evolution for Stable ABIs
- Property Wrappers

You can also use AppCode to write code using the new function builder feature that allows you to create DSLs in Swift.
 
### Code Coverage for Unit Tests
 
AppCode 2019.2 introduces code coverage for unit tests, which helps you measure how much of your code is covered by tests and identify the parts that need more testing. You can run your tests with coverage using a simple action, and see the results in the editor gutter, in the Project view, and in a dedicated tool window. You can also filter and sort the coverage data by different criteria.
 
### LLDB Disassembly View
 
If you need to debug your code at the assembly level, AppCode 2019.2 has you covered. You can use the Force Step Into action to jump into the disassembled code when the source code is not available, or select a frame in the Debug tool window to see the disassembly. You can also use code completion for LLDB commands in the debugger console.
 
### Enhanced Refactorings and Code Generation
 
AppCode 2019.2 improves some of the existing refactorings and code generation actions for Swift, such as:

- Create from usage for enum cases
- Folding closures
- Join lines for variable declaration and initialization
- Highlighting unresolved references
- Completion for key paths and conditional conformance

These features help you write and transform your code faster and easier.
